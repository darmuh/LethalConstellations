# Lethal Constellations Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.2.1]
 - Fixed issue of non-host players being unable to join the lobby with this mod present.
 - OneTimeUnlocks for Constellations is now dependent on whether or not [LethalNetworkAPI](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/xilophor/LethalNetworkAPI/) is present.
	- This will be a soft compatibility and if LethalNetworkAPI is not present then constellations will fall back to normal purchase behaviour.
 - Changed moon pricing list to use the actual extendedLevel from LLL rather than a string reference of it's name to hopefully fix issues with prices not updating.
