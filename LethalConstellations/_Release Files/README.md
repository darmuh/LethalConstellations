# Lethal Constellations

### Separate your moons list by constellations. 
- This mod will dynamically change your moons list depending on a configurable constellations listing.

**NOTE:** This mod is still in early development. Please report any issues you find as you are essentially a beta tester.

### Current Features:
- If a moon is not inside the current constellation it will be hidden from the moons page and locked (using LLL)
- Contains two config files. A static config and a generated one.
	- Static config will dictate what is generated in the generated config.
	- Generated config is generated after first lobby load.
		- Currently this configuration cannot be modified by LethalConfig.
- Customizable keywords/text.
	- Dont like the word constellation? Change it in the config!
	- This mod will attempt to replace any pre-existing keywords from the config with radarbooster names as a fail safe.
		- Please avoid overwriting any base-game keywords or other mods' keywords.
	- Customizable text for all different types of terminal commands relating to the constellations.
- Current Constellation will be updated on lobby load, works between save files!
- Moon prices can also be modified by this mod or left to be handled elsewhere.
- You can set routing to a specific constellation to cost credits or allow for your constellations to be free.
- Routing to a new constellation will take you to that constellation's default moon.
	- This essentially makes the cost of routing to this moon however much it costs to route to your constellation.
- Set which constellations the company can be routed to in the constellations config
- Hide special constellations from the menu or if you cant afford it (with configuration options)
- Set shorts for the constellation menu and specific constellations
- This mod does not do any patching, all game patching is done by OpenLib & LethalLevelLoader.

### If you have any ideas on how to make this mod better please feel free to reach out!
